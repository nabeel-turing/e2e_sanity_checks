It\\'s pretty straightforward, but it\\'ll take a few steps to automate. My main goal is to send out emails to pet owners with upcoming vaccination appointments.\\n\\nFirst, I need to get the list of appointments from the \"Appointments\" Google Calendar. I\\'ll use the `google_calendar.list_calendar_list_entries()` tool to pull a list of all my calendars.  I\\'ll then search through that list to find the one labeled \"Appointments\" – that\\'s where all the relevant event details live.\\n\\nOnce I have the right calendar ID, I\\'ll move on to finding the actual appointments for the next week.  Using `google_calendar.list_events()`, I\\'ll filter for events happening between today and a week from today. The tricky part here is setting the correct `timeMin` and `timeMax` parameters.  Since today is February 27, 2024,  I\\'ll need to define `timeMin` as 2024-02-27T00:00:00Z and `timeMax` as 2024-03-05T23:59:59Z.  I\\'ll also have to add a search parameter, `q`, to filter for events that specifically mention \"vaccination\" in either their summary or description. This will give me a list of relevant vaccination appointments.  From each appointment, I\\'ll need to extract the pet owner\\'s email address – that\\'s the key piece of information for sending the reminder.\\n\\nNext, I\\'ll need to find the vaccination reminder email template. It\\'s saved as a draft in Gmail. I\\'ll use `gmail.list_drafts()` to get a list of all drafts, and then I\\'ll look for a draft with a subject like \"Vaccination Reminder\". This subject line is a good starting point.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll put it all together. For each vaccination appointment I identified: I\\'ll personalize the reminder email. I\\'ll get the draft content using `gmail.get_draft()` and then fill in the pet\\'s name and appointment details into the template.  I\\'ll be able to pull those details right from the event details I got from the calendar earlier.  Then, I\\'ll use the pet owner\\'s email address and the populated draft to send the reminder using `gmail.send_message()`.\\n\\nFunction call:\\ngoogle_calendar_list_calendar_list_entries()\\n###\\n\\n\\n###\\nEntry type: tool\\nResponse\\n{\\'items\\': [{\\'id\\': \\'cal-1000\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Work Calendar\\', \\'description\\': \\'Company-wide meetings and deadlines\\', \\'timeZone\\': \\'America/New_York\\', \\'primary\\': True}, {\\'id\\': \\'cal-2000\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Personal Calendar\\', \\'description\\': \\'My personal events and reminders\\', \\'timeZone\\': \\'America/Los_Angeles\\', \\'primary\\': False}, {\\'id\\': \\'cal-3000\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Family Calendar\\', \\'description\\': \\'Shared events with family members\\', \\'timeZone\\': \\'America/Denver\\', \\'primary\\': False}, {\\'id\\': \\'cal-4000\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Project Calendar\\', \\'description\\': \\'\\', \\'timeZone\\': \\'Europe/London\\', \\'primary\\': False}, {\\'id\\': \\'cal-5000\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Team Collaboration Calendar\\', \\'description\\': \\'Shared calendar for team meetings and collaborative events\\', \\'timeZone\\': \\'America/New_York\\', \\'primary\\': False}, {\\'summary\\': \\'Appointments\\', \\'id\\': \\'613de222-674b-42f6-847c-5967ae61fc83\\'}], \\'nextPageToken\\': None}\\n###\\n\\n\\n###\\nEntry type: ai\\nThinking:\\n**Summarizing the Task: Vaccination Reminder Email System**\\n\\nOkay, so I\\'m building this system to send reminder emails about upcoming vaccination appointments. The core of this is pulling the information from Google Calendar and using a draft email I\\'ve already set up in Gmail.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out where the appointments live. That means hitting up Google Calendar, specifically the \"Appointments\" calendar. I know I have the calendar ID:  \\'613de222-674b-42f6-847c-5967ae61fc83\\'. I need to grab the appointments scheduled for the next week, so I\\'ll set a time range. For now, let\\'s assume today\\'s date is February 27, 2024. I will need to use `date` and `timedelta` to generate the correct `timeMin` (today\\'s date) and `timeMax` (a week from today). When listing the events, I\\'m going to filter using the query string \"vaccination\".\\n\\nNext, I have to find that draft email template in Gmail.  I\\'ll use `gmail.list_drafts` to locate it, presumably by a specific subject or content. Once I have the events and the draft email, I\\'ll loop through each appointment, personalize the draft with the appointment details, and send the reminder to the attendees.\\n\\nFunction call:\\ngoogle_calendar_list_events(timeMax=\"2024-03-05T23:59:59Z\", calendarId=\"613de222-674b-42f6-847c-5967ae61fc83\", timeMin=\"2024-02-27T00:00:00Z\", q=\"vaccination\")\\n###\\n\\n\\n###\\nEntry type: tool\\nResponse\\n{\\'items\\': []}\\n###\\n\\n\\n###\\nEntry type: ai\\nThinking:\\n**No Appointments Found**\\n\\nOkay, so here\\'s what I\\'ve figured out. My goal is to send vaccination appointment reminders, right? This boils down to three key steps: grab the info from Google Calendar, locate the email template in Gmail, and then send those emails.\\n\\nFirst, I identified the \"Appointments\" calendar – that was straightforward. I\\'m working with the time frame of \"the next week,\" which, given today is February 27, 2024, I needed to define precisely. I used `timeMin` and `timeMax` parameters to make sure I had the right date range.  I\\'m searching for \"vaccination\" appointments, and I\\'ve got a draft template already. I used the `google_calendar.list_calendar_list_entries()` function to identify the specific Calendar ID. Then I used `google_calendar.list_events()` function with the Calendar ID to search events.\\n\\nHowever, the crucial bit is that after calling `google_calendar.list_events()`, the response was an empty list. Basically, the calendar shows *no* vaccination appointments for the next week. That\\'s it, plain and simple.\\n\\nSince there are no appointments to remind about, there\\'s nothing for me to do. It looks like I need to tell the user that.  So, I\\'ll inform them that I didn\\'t find any upcoming vaccination appointments in the \"Appointments\" calendar for the next week, so I couldn\\'t send out any reminders. That should be a clear and concise response.\\n\\nString content:\\nI couldn\\'t find any vaccination appointments in your \"Appointments\" calendar for the next week, so I was unable to send any reminder emails.\\n###',\n",

There are a couple of tools I can use: Gmail functions and Google Calendar functions. \\n\\nFirst, I have to find the ID for the \"Appointments\" calendar by fetching the entries and locating the correct summary. After that, I’ll list the events for the upcoming week based on the calendar ID I find.\\n**Filtering vaccination appointments**\\n\\nI need to filter for vaccination appointments by setting the query \\'q\\' to \\'vaccination\\' since the tool allows for this kind of search. I can also utilize the \\'singleEvents\\' parameter to expand any recurring events. The appointment range should be from now to one week from today, which I’ll specify using ISO datetimes. \\n\\nSince the user’s timezone is unknown, I\\'ll default to UTC. I’ll also look for the pet owners\\' emails, which should be available as attendees in the calendar events.\\n**Finding and sending reminders**\\n\\nI’m going to iterate through the events to find attendees who are the pet owners. I won’t ask for clarification here; I’ll assume each event has a main attendee that is the owner. I’ll filter out any organizers or resources. \\n\\nNext, I need to use the vaccination reminder template saved as a draft in Gmail. I can query for drafts using \\'subject:\\' or looking for \\'vaccination reminder template\\' in the content. I’ll retrieve the draft list and then get the content of the draft for sending.\\n**Processing draft templates**\\n\\nThe `list_drafts` function should yield a list with IDs, which I can use to fetch the draft’s full content. Once I have the subject and body of the draft, I plan to personalize messages for each pet owner, possibly including details like appointment date, pet name, and location. \\n\\nWhile we only have event details to work with, I can use the draft as is, maybe with placeholders for specific details like the date. It sounds fine to use the template as the email body and append any necessary appointment details for clarity before sending.\\n**Searching for vaccination drafts**\\n\\nI can use different query forms to locate the vaccination reminder drafts. I’ll start with two queries: \\'subject:vaccination reminder\\' and \\'vaccination reminder\\'. If that doesn\\'t yield results, I can try \\'subject:vaccination\\' or just \\'vaccination\\'. \\n\\nI need to be careful though, as I can’t do multiple list calls ideally. Once I find at least one draft, I’ll assemble the subject and body for each recipient, using the draft\\'s subject and potentially prefixing it with appointment details. Then, I\\'ll send the emails in parallel using the gmail send function.

I\\'ll check the draft template, but calling Gmail seems unnecessary right now.\\n**Summarizing appointment notifications**\\n\\nSince we\\'ve already checked the calendar functions, there\\'s no need to contact Gmail without any recipients. I can provide a helpful summary like: no events matched, and zero emails were sent. While I can\\'t ask for adjustments, I might consider checking for events in the next 14 days. However, since the user asked specifically about next week, I’ll stick to that. So, I\\'ll report that no vaccination appointments were found in the specified time frame, and no emails were sent.\\n**Finalizing appointment notifications**\\n\\nI’m considering whether events could exist even though our query didn’t return any matches. If no results appeared when listing, that likely means there are truly no appointments. To finalize, I’ll confirm that the user requested reminders for pet owners with vaccination appointments in their \"Appointments\" Google Calendar. Since no appointments are scheduled, I can state, \"Done: No emails sent because no events found,\" while noting the time window used.
