def commit_fact_to_memory(information_to_store):
    """
    Save a specific piece of information or fact to long-term memory.

    Use this function when the user explicitly asks you to remember something,
    or when they state a clear, concise fact that seems important to retain
    for future interactions.

    Args:
        information_to_store (str): The specific fact or piece of information to remember.
                   Should be a clear, self-contained statement.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary indicating the outcome:
            - 'success' (bool): True if the memory was saved successfully.
            - 'message' (str): A message describing the outcome.

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If the information_to_store is empty or not a string.
        WorkspaceNotAvailableError: If workspace_root is not configured.
        ValueError: If the memory cannot be saved due to file system issues.
