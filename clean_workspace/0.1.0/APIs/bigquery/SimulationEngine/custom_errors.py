"""
Error handling module for BigQuery API simulation.

This module defines custom exceptions used throughout the BigQuery API simulation.
These exceptions help provide clear error messages and proper error handling for
various scenarios that might occur during query execution and database operations.

Related Modules:
    - query_executor.py: Uses these exceptions for query execution errors
    - utils.py: Uses these exceptions for utility function errors
    - db.py: Uses these exceptions for database operation errors

class BigQueryClientError(Exception):
    """Base exception for errors originating from the BigQuery client or interactions.
    
    This is the parent class for all BigQuery-related exceptions in the simulation.
    It provides a common base for error handling and allows catching all BigQuery
    related errors with a single exception handler.
    
    Example:
        try:
            execute_query("SELECT * FROM table")
        except BigQueryClientError as e:
            print(f"BigQuery error occurred: {e}")

class InvalidQueryError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when a BigQuery SQL query is syntactically invalid or contains
    semantic errors that prevent it from being executed.

    Common scenarios:
        - Malformed SQL syntax
        - References to non-existent tables or columns
        - Invalid data type operations
        - Unsupported query types (e.g., non-SELECT queries)

    Example:
        try:
            execute_query("SELECT * FROM nonexistent_table")
        except InvalidQueryError as e:
            print(f"Invalid query: {e}")

class InvalidInputError(BigQueryClientError):

    dataset is assumed and not found).
