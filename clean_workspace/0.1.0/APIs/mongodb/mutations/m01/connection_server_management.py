    Switch to a different MongoDB connection.

    Switches to a different MongoDB connection. If the user has configured a
    connection string or has previously called the connect tool, a connection
    is already established, and there is no need to call this function unless
    the user has explicitly requested to switch to a new instance. Options for
    switching the current MongoDB connection can be provided via the
    `connectionString` parameter. If a `connectionString` argument is not
    supplied, the function will attempt to use a connection string from the
    existing configuration.

    Args:
        new_connection_uri (Optional[str]): MongoDB connection string to switch to
            (in the mongodb:// or mongodb+srv:// format). Defaults to None,
            in which case a default connection string will be used.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Indicates the outcome of the connection switch attempt.
            This dictionary contains the following keys:
            status (str): 'success' if the switch was successful, 'failure'
                otherwise.
            message (Optional[str]): A descriptive message about the connection
                attempt (e.g., error details on failure, or success
                confirmation).
            active_connection_info (Optional[str]): Information about the new
                active connection if the switch was successful (e.g., a
                masked connection string, server version, database name, or
                an alias).

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If the provided new_connection_uri is empty, contains
            only whitespace, or does not start with 'mongodb://' or 'mongodb+srv://'.
        ConnectionError: If the connection cannot be established by the DB layer
            (e.g., actual connection failure, issues with the "default" target).
