    This function searches for files in the workspace using a glob pattern. It returns a list of
    file paths relative to the workspace root that match the pattern.
    The search is limited to 20 results. This tool is suitable when the filename pattern
    for the desired files is known. Glob patterns are matched starting from the root of the
    workspace folder.

    Examples:
    - '**/*.{js,ts}' to match all js/ts files in the workspace.
    - 'src/**' to match all files under the top-level src folder.
    - '**/foo/**/*.js' to match all js files under any foo folder in the workspace.

    { changed code }
    // ...existing code...

    An example of how to format an edit to an existing `Person` class:
    class Person {
        // ...existing code...
        age: number;
        // ...existing code...
        getAge() {
            return this.age;
        }
    }

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path of the file within the workspace that needs to be modified.
        edit_instructions (str): The content representing the changes to be applied to the file. Follow the concise diff-like format: use comments (e.g., '// ...existing code...') to represent regions of unchanged code and provide only the new or modified code blocks.
        explanation (str): A natural language explanation of the changes being made in this edit. This should be generated first.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the result, with keys:
            file_path (str): The absolute path of the file that was targeted.
            status (str): Status of the edit operation (e.g., 'success', 'failed_to_apply', 'file_not_found').
            message (Optional[str]): Details of the operation or error.

    Raises:
        EditConflictError: If the target path is a directory, or content is an uneditable placeholder.
        PermissionDeniedError: If the file is marked read-only.
        InvalidEditFormatError: Conditions for this are less direct with LLM-based rewrite.
                                It might be raised if, hypothetically, an LLM output format was strictly defined
                                and not met in a way that other errors don't cover. Currently, LLM content
                                issues are typically mapped to 'failed_to_apply' or are part of a 'success'
                                if the content is merely low quality but technically applied.

Apply the following changes:

Detailed edit instructions/hints (interpret these to achieve the changes described in the explanation):

Your goal is to generate the complete, new file content after applying all specified changes.
- Ensure that parts of the file not affected by the explanation or edit instructions are preserved perfectly.
- Pay close attention to maintaining correct syntax, indentation, and overall code quality or file structure.
- If the request implies deleting all content (e.g., "make the file empty"), output an empty response. If the request is to delete the file itself, that's a different operation; for this task, output empty content if the file should become empty.

Output ONLY the complete new file content. Do not include any preamble, additional explanations, comments about your changes, markdown code fences, or diff formats.
