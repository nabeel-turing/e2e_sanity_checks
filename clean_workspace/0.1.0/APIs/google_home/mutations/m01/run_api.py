    Runs a general operation on smart home devices and returns the status.

    Args:
        devices_to_operate_on (List[str]): Unique identifiers of smart home devices.
        operation_to_perform (str): Name of the operation to run.
        operation_parameters (Optional[List[str]]): Optional list of values for the operation.
        op_execution_time (Optional[str]): Time to execute the operation, expected in the format of "HH:MM:SS"
        op_execution_date (Optional[str]): Date to execute the operation, expected in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD"
        op_time_period_specifier (Optional[str]): Whether time_of_day is AM or PM or UNKNOWN
        op_execution_delay (Optional[str]): How long to wait before executing the operation. Example format are 5s, 20m, 1h
        op_duration (Optional[str]): How long the operation should last. Example format are 5s, 20m, 1h

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of mutation results for each device.
            - commands (Dict[str, Any]): The commands that were executed.
                - device_ids (List[str]): The IDs of the devices that were mutated.
                - commands (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The commands that were executed.
                    - trait (str): The name of the trait that was changed.
                    - command_names (List[str]): The names of the commands that were executed.
                    - command_values (List[str]): The new values of the commands.
            - result (str): The result of the mutation (e.g., 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE').
            - device_execution_results (Dict[str, Any]): The execution results for each device.
                - text_to_speech (str): Text to be spoken to the user.
                - results (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The execution results for each device.
                    - device_id (str): The ID of the device.
                    - result (str): The result of the execution (e.g., 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE').

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If the input parameters are invalid.
        DeviceNotFoundError: If any of the requested devices_to_operate_on are not found.
