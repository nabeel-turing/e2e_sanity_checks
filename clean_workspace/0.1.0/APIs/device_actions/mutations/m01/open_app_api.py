def launch_application(application_to_start, package_identifier=None, intent_extras=None):
    """
    Opens the requested application on the device.

    Alternative app names:
     - If the user wants to open "alarms" or "timers" but there is no app with an
       obviously matching name, open any clock app, if present, as a less-preferred fallback.

    Args:
        application_to_start (str): The name of the application to open.
            This name has to exactly match one of the names produced by `get_installed_apps`.
        package_identifier (Optional[str]): The package name of the application to open.
        intent_extras (Optional[str]): The extras in json string format to send to the application being opened.
            Note:
             * This should only be populated when opening "Pixel Screenshots".
             * When opening "Pixel Screenshots", always extract the information-seeking part of the user prompt and populate it in the extras field.
             * The key of the extras field is "query". The value of the extras field is the query extracted from the user prompt.
             * The query should be a full question/sentence, unless the original user prompt is too terse to infer one.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the result of the action.
            - result (str): A message indicating the result of the action.
            - card_id (str): A unique identifier for the action card.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is invalid.
        AppNotFoundError: If the app is not found.
        AppNameAndPackageMismatchError: If the app name and package name do not match.
        DevicePoweredOffError: If the device is powered off.
