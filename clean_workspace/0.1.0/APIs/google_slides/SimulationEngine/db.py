"""
Database structure and state management for Google Slides API simulation.

This module defines the in-memory database (DB) structure by referencing
the shared Google Drive DB and provides functionality for saving and loading
the database state via the GDrive module.

The database (DB) is shared with Google Drive and organizes user data under
DB['users'][userId]. For Google Slides, 'files' within this structure would
typically represent presentation files. Key components include:

- 'about': Metadata about the user's account.
- 'files': { fileId: {...}, ... } - Contains presentations (as files).
- 'counters': For generating unique IDs.
 (Other GDrive structures like 'drives', 'comments', etc., are also shared.)

# In-Memory Slides Database Structure (Shared with GDrive)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Google Slides data is stored within the shared Google Drive database (DRIVE_DB).
# Presentation files are typically stored under DB['users'][userId]['files'].
# For a detailed structure of DRIVE_DB, refer to gdrive/db.py.
#
# Relevant shared structures for Slides might include:
# - 'files': Where presentation metadata and content references are stored.
#   Each file entry could have fields like:
#     - 'id': Unique identifier for the presentation.
#     - 'name': Title of the presentation.
#     - 'mimeType': 'application/vnd.google-apps.presentation'.
#     - 'createdTime', 'modifiedTime': Timestamps.
#     - 'parents': List of parent folder IDs in Drive.
#     - 'permissions': Access permissions.
#     - 'slides': (Potentially, if Slides has specific content structure not just in Drive file content)
#                 A list or dictionary of slide objects within the presentation.
#
# - 'comments', 'replies': For comments on slides/presentations.
# - 'counters': For unique IDs for presentations (as files), comments, etc.
