    This function retrieves the balance from Stripe. It takes no input.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary representing the Stripe balance, containing the following keys:
            object (str): String representing the object's type, typically balance.
            available (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Funds that are available to be paid out. Each item in the list is a dictionary representing a balance in a specific currency, with the following fields:
                amount (int): Balance amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents for USD).
                currency (str): Three-letter ISO currency code (e.g., usd, eur).
                source_types (Optional[Dict[str, int]]): A dictionary breaking down this portion of the balance by source type (e.g., {card: 10000, bank_account: 5000}). Keys are source type strings (e.g., card, fpx) and values are amounts in the smallest currency unit.
            pending (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Funds that are not yet available in the balance. Each item in the list is a dictionary representing a pending balance in a specific currency, with the following fields:
                amount (int): Balance amount in the smallest currency unit.
                currency (str): Three-letter ISO currency code.
                source_types (Optional[Dict[str, int]]): A dictionary breaking down this portion of the pending balance by source type.
            livemode (bool): True if the object exists in live mode, or false if the object exists in test mode.
