    This tool will create a product in Stripe.

    This function creates a product in Stripe. It accepts a name for the product,
    which is mandatory, and an optional description to further detail the product.

    Args:
        item_name (str): The name of the product.
        item_details (Optional[str]): The description of the product.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary representing the created Stripe product. Fields include:
            id (str): Unique identifier for the product.
            object (str): String representing the object's type, always "product".
            name (str): The product's name.
            description (Optional[str]): The product's description.
            active (bool): Whether the product is currently active and available for use.
            created (int): Unix timestamp of when the product was created.
            updated (int): Unix timestamp of when the product was last updated.
            livemode (bool): Indicates if the object exists in live mode (true) or test mode (false).
            metadata (Optional[Dict[str, str]]): A set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. It can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.

    Raises:
        InvalidRequestError: If required parameters are missing or invalid (e.g., item_name is empty).
        ApiError: For other general Stripe API errors (e.g., network issues, authentication problems).

    This tool will fetch a list of Products from Stripe.

            object (str): String representing the object's type, typically "list".
            data (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of product objects. Each product object includes the following fields:
                id (str): Unique identifier for the product.
                object (str): String representing the object's type, typically "product".

                livemode (bool): True if the object exists in live mode or false if the object exists in test mode.
                metadata (Optional[Dict[str, str]]): A set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. It can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
            has_more (bool): True if there are more objects available after this list. If false, this list contains all remaining objects.

    Raises:
        InvalidRequestError: If the page_size parameter is invalid (e.g., out of range).
