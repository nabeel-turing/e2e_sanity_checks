'''
Custom error classes for the Azure Simulation Engine.

This module defines custom exceptions used throughout the Azure API simulation.
These exceptions are derived from the "raises" sections of the Azure MCP tools JSON definition,
focusing on the P0 API functions. They help provide clear error messages and
proper error handling for various scenarios encountered during simulated API operations.

Related Simulation Engine Modules:
    - utils.py: May use these exceptions for utility function errors.
    - future API function modules: Will raise these exceptions to simulate API call failures.

    Base class for all Azure simulation errors.

        message (str): The error message.
        status_code (int): An HTTP-like status code for the error.
        error_code (str): The name of the error class (e.g., "ResourceNotFoundError").

    Simulates a permission denial for an authenticated identity.
    Raised when the user or service principal has authenticated successfully
    but lacks the necessary permissions for the requested action on a resource.

    Common Scenarios:
        - Missing required RBAC roles (e.g., Reader, Contributor).
        - Access policies on a resource (like Key Vault) do not grant the operation.

    Simulates a situation where a specified Azure resource was not found.

    Common Scenarios:
        - Referencing a resource by a name or ID that does not exist.

    Simulates a conflict with the current state of a resource.
    This error indicates that the requested operation cannot be completed because
    it conflicts with an existing state or configuration of the target resource.

    Common Scenarios:
        - Attempting to create a resource that already exists with the same name.

    but failed due to semantic issues, data access problems, or resource limitations.

    Common Scenarios:

    Common Scenarios:
