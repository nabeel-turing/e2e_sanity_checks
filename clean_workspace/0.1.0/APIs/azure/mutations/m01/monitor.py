    Gets the health of an entity from a specified Azure Monitor Health Model.

    This function retrieves the health of a specific entity from an Azure Monitor Health Model.
    It returns detailed entity health information. To perform this operation, the entity identifier,
    the health model name, the Azure resource group, and the subscription must be provided.

    Args:
        entity_id_for_health_get (str): The entity to get health for.
        model_name_for_health_get (str): The name of the health model for which to get the health.
        rg_for_health_get (str): The name of the Azure resource group. This is a logical container for Azure resources.
        subscription_for_health_get (str): The Azure subscription ID or name. This can be either the GUID identifier or the display name of the Azure subscription to use.
        auth_method_for_health_get (Optional[str]): Authentication method to use. Options: 'credential' (Azure CLI/managed identity), 'key' (access key), or 'connectionString'. Defaults to None.
        delay_for_health_get_retry (Optional[str]): Initial delay in seconds between retry attempts. For exponential backoff, this value is used as the base. Defaults to None.
        max_delay_for_health_get_retry (Optional[str]): Maximum delay in seconds between retries, regardless of the retry strategy. Defaults to None.
        max_retries_for_health_get (Optional[str]): Maximum number of retry attempts for failed operations before giving up. Defaults to None.
        mode_for_health_get_retry (Optional[str]): Retry strategy to use. 'fixed' uses consistent delays, 'exponential' increases delay between attempts. Defaults to None.
        timeout_for_health_get_net (Optional[str]): Network operation timeout in seconds. Operations taking longer than this will be cancelled. Defaults to None.
        tenant_for_health_get (Optional[str]): The Azure Active Directory tenant ID or name. This can be either the GUID identifier or the display name of your Azure AD tenant. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Health information for the specified entity. This dictionary includes the following keys:
            entityId (str): The ID of the entity whose health is reported.
            healthState (str): The current health state of the entity (e.g., 'Healthy', 'Unhealthy', 'Warning').
            causes (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of causes contributing to the health state. Each dictionary in this list represents a cause and contains:
                description (str): Description of the cause.
                severity (str): Severity of the cause (e.g., 'Critical', 'Error', 'Warning', 'Information').
                recommendedActions (List[str]): Recommended actions to address the cause.

    Raises:
        ResourceNotFoundError: If the specified health model or entity_id_for_health_get does not exist.
        InvalidInputError: If required parameters like entity_id or model_name_for_health_get are missing or invalid.
