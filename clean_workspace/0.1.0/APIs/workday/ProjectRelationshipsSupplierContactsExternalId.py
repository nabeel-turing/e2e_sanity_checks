Project Supplier Contact Relationships by External ID Module

This module provides functionality for managing relationships between projects and supplier
contacts using external identifiers in the Workday Strategic Sourcing system. It supports
operations for adding and removing supplier contacts from projects using external IDs.

The module interfaces with the simulation database to maintain project-supplier contact
relationships, allowing for efficient management of supplier contact assignments to projects
using external identifiers. This is particularly useful when integrating with external
systems that maintain their own identifiers for projects and supplier contacts.

Functions:
    post: Adds supplier contacts to a project using external IDs
    delete: Removes supplier contacts from a project using external IDs
