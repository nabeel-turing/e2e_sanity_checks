Project Type Management by ID Module

This module provides functionality for managing project types using their unique internal
identifiers in the Workday Strategic Sourcing system. It supports operations for retrieving
project type details.

The module interfaces with the simulation database to provide access to project type
definitions, which include configuration settings, default values, and metadata for
different types of projects in the system.

Functions:
    get: Retrieves project type details by ID
