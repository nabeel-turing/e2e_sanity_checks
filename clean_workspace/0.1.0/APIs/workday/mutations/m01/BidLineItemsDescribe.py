    Retrieves the list of available fields for bid line item objects.

    This function returns a comprehensive list of all fields that can be present
    in a bid line item object, based on the schema definition in the system.

    Returns:
        list: A list of strings, where each string represents a field name
            available in bid line item objects. The list includes all possible
            fields that can be present in a bid line item.

    Note:
        The function uses the first bid line item in the database as a template
        to determine the available fields. This assumes that all bid line items
        share the same schema structure.
