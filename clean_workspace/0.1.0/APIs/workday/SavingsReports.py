Savings Reports Management Module

This module provides functionality for managing savings reports in the Workday Strategic
Sourcing system. It supports operations for retrieving savings report entries and their
associated schema definitions.

The module interfaces with the simulation database to provide access to savings report
data, which includes detailed information about cost savings, financial metrics, and
related reporting information.

Functions:
    get_entries: Retrieves all savings report entries from the system
    get_schema: Retrieves the schema definition for savings reports
