    Lists the history of all changes to the given mailbox.

    Retrieves a list of mailbox history records for the specified user.
    Note: Filtering parameters (`start_history_id`, `label_id`,
    `history_types`) and pagination (`page_token`) are included
    for API compatibility but are not fully implemented. The function currently returns
    stored history records up to `max_results`.

    Args:
        account_id_for_history (str): The user's email address. The special value 'me'
                can be used to indicate the authenticated user. Defaults to 'me'.
        max_history_entries (int): The maximum number of history records to return.
                     Defaults to 100.
        history_pagination_token (str): Page token to retrieve a specific page of results.
                    Defaults to ''. (Currently ignored).
        initial_history_id (str): Returns history records after the specified
                         `start_history_id`. Defaults to ''. (Currently ignored).
        target_label_id_for_history (str): History records specific to the specified label in uppercase.
                  Defaults to ''. (Currently ignored).
        event_types_to_include (Optional[List[str]]): History types to retrieve. Defaults to None.
                       (Currently ignored).

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing:
            - 'history' (List[Dict]): List of history records.
            - 'nextPageToken' (Optional[str]): Token for retrieving the next page of results.
                Currently always None.
            - 'historyId' (str): The current history ID of the mailbox.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If the specified `account_id_for_history` does not exist in the database.
