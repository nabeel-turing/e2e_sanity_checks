"""
Custom error classes for the Shopify API Simulation.

These errors are designed to be raised by the API tool implementations
to indicate specific failure conditions. They are simple type markers
inheriting from a common base error.

    Base class for all custom exceptions in the Shopify API simulation.
    Allows catching all simulation-specific errors with a single except block.
