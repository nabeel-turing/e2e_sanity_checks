    Searches for one-stop (connecting) flights between two airports.

    This function searches for flights with connections in the SAP Concur system
    between the specified departure and arrival airports on a specific date.
    It returns individual flight segments that together form one-stop journeys,

    it will return separate segments for JFK to ATL and ATL to SEA.
