    """
    Re-run a workflow run.

    This API endpoint allows re-running a previously executed workflow run.
    It creates a new workflow run attempt based on the original run's configuration.
    The new run will start in a 'queued' state.

    Args:
        github_account_holder (str): The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
        repository_for_rerun (str): The name of the repository without the .git extension. The name is not case sensitive.
        original_run_id_for_rerun (int): The unique identifier of the workflow run to re-run.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: An empty dictionary to acknowledge successful processing of the re-run request.

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If the provided github_account_holder, repository_for_rerun, or original_run_id_for_rerun are invalid (e.g., empty strings, non-positive original_run_id_for_rerun).
        NotFoundError: If the specified github_account_holder, repository, or the original original_run_id_for_rerun does not exist.
        ConflictError: If the original workflow run is currently in a state that prohibits re-running (e.g., already in_progress or queued).
