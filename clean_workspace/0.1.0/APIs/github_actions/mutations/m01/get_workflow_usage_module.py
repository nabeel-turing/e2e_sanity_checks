    Get usage statistics of a workflow.

    This function retrieves the billable usage statistics for a specific workflow,
    broken down by operating system.

    Args:
        github_organization_or_user (str): The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
        source_repository_slug (str): The name of the repository without the .git extension. The name is not case sensitive.
        target_workflow_id_or_filename (Union[int, str]): The ID of the workflow (as an positive integer) or the workflow's filename
                                       (as a string, e.g., 'ci.yml').

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary representing the usage statistics for the workflow.
            This dictionary contains the following key:
            billable (Dict[str, Dict[str, int]]): Contains billable time information
                for different runner OS types. This dictionary maps OS strings
                (e.g., 'UBUNTU', 'MACOS', 'WINDOWS') to OS-specific usage
                dictionaries. Each OS-specific usage dictionary (the value
                associated with an OS string key) contains the following keys:
                    total_ms (int): Total milliseconds used by runners for that OS.
                    jobs (int): Number of jobs run on runners for that OS.
                Note: An OS key (e.g., 'UBUNTU') might be absent from the `billable`
                dictionary if there is no usage for that OS.

    Raises:
        InvalidInputError: If github_organization_or_user, source_repository_slug, or target_workflow_id_or_filename are invalid.
        NotFoundError: If the specified github_organization_or_user, repository, or workflow ID does not exist.
