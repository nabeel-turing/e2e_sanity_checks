Down Payment: 75% of the estimated total cost, due immediately upon signing this SOW (no dilly-dallying). Down Payment Amount Due: $3,375.00 Payment Schedule: * Final Payment: Remaining balance of $1,125.00 due upon final delivery of all deliverables (and Client's satisfactory grunt of approval). Accepted Payment Methods: Cash (no funny money), Bank Transfer (must clear immediately). Late Payment: Payments are considered late if not received within 2 days of the invoice date. Late payments will incur a late fee of 20% per day (because time is money, and the Designer's patience is limited). Additional Costs: Any services requested by the Client outside the defined Scope of Work will be subject to a separate change order and billed at a ridiculously high hourly rate or a price that feels \"fair\" to the Designer at the time."
