      "text": "The IronSpan Project represents a critical infrastructure undertaking designed to replace the aging Cormorant Narrows Bridge over the Swan River Estuary in Perth, Western Australia. The existing structure, while serving the region for decades, faces capacity limitations and increasing maintenance demands, hindering efficient traffic flow and future regional development. The IronSpan Project will deliver a modern, high-capacity, aesthetically significant bridge structure engineered for long-term durability and resilience. This overview outlines the project's background, objectives, detailed scope of work, key delivery milestones, involved stakeholders, commitment to environmental stewardship and occupational health and safety throughout the project lifecycle. Successful delivery will significantly enhance transport connectivity, support economic growth, and provide a landmark structure for Western Australia."

      "text": "The current Cormorant Narrows Bridge was constructed in the 1960s and has been a vital link in Perth's transport network. However, significant population growth, increased freight movement, and evolving engineering standards necessitate its replacement. Recent structural assessments and traffic modelling studies commissioned by Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA) have highlighted several key drivers for the IronSpan Project:"
